# Everything I used to learn everything I know about web dev

### HTML & CSS.

- I learned these a _long_-ass time ago, so I have no idea how I learned the basics. I took a refresher from [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.com), though, which is great, which got me up to speed on HTML5 semantic elements and new stuff in CSS3. Besides that, Google and Stack Overflow everything. [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is a great reference guide for this if I ever forget exactly how something works in HTML or CSS.
- [What the Flexbox?!](https://flexbox.io/) I'm not totally in love with Wes Bos's teaching style, as he's a little hard to follow sometimes, but this is a great introduction to the hard-to-wrap-your-head-around (at least to me) CSS flexbox. Before this, I was stuck using `float: right` like it was 2000. Free video course.
- [CSS Grid](https://cssgrid.io/) Another Wes Bos course. Great way to learn the new CSS Grid, and goes really in-depth so it sticks with you.

### JavaScript

- [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.com). Great resource that teaches you interactively while having you build small, real-world projects to test your skills and problem-solving abilities. I love the teaching method in that it's not just follow along by copying their code, but gets you in the habit of figuring things out for yourself. And it's free, too.
- [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA). Great video courses about literally _everything_, including JavaScript. Has some great introductory videos on JavaScript if you like following along visually, but his teaching style can be a little dry. Good for learning some basics before making some things on your own. His paid courses on Udemy are usually good, and only \$10/each.

### React

- [React for Beginners](https://reactforbeginners.com/). This is a great introductory course that has you building a semi-complex app. I feel like I learn better through videos, and this course gave me enough confidence to start some basic React apps. A little pricey, though.
- [React 16 for Everyone](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/react-16-for-everyone). Took this one just as a refresher. Very basic, but good course on React. Paid.
- [React Hooks for Everyone](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/react-hooks-for-everyone). Wanted to get up to speed on React Hooks. This course is a pretty good introduction. Paid.
- [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/). Easy-to-follow documentation to set up your first Gatsby blog. Clearly-written and not too technical like some docs.

### Node.js

- [Node.js, Express & MongoDB Dev to Deployment](https://www.udemy.com/nodejs-express-mongodb-dev-to-deployment/) Pretty comprehensive course by Brad Traversy. Everything you need to know about the basics of a Node.js backend. Paid.

### General Web Dev

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is a great reference guide for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Don't use W3 Schools, it still sucks ass. MDN has great explanations of everything and examples. Great resource.
- [Syntax.fm](https://syntax.fm/). Great web dev podcast about front-end development by Wes Bos and Scott Tolinski.
- [React Podcast](https://syntax.fm/). Great web dev podcast about front-end development by Wes Bos and Scott Tolinski.
